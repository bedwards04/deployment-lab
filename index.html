    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Utah. I love anything that has to do with sports or the outdoors. I have a big family of 12 (including in-laws and nieces and nephews), and love them to death. I really enjoy learning new things, and aquiring new skills to help me in my day-to-day life. I am looking forward to starting my career in tech, and am excited to see what opportunities become available as I get better everyday. </p>
